# GENESIS SEED: The Open-Source SBRM Logic Engine

## 1. The Paradigm
This node serves as the absolute baseline context for all future AI interactions regarding this system. We fundamentally reject tightly-coupled SQL relational databases and LLM hallucination in financial proofs. We are building a global, decentralized, multidimensional knowledge graph for accounting and tax compliance. 

## 2. The Immutable Axioms
1. **Absolute Data Sovereignty (File Over App):** Business logic and financial facts are strictly decoupled from application code. They exist as independent, globally addressable Markdown (`.md`) files. The database is merely a projection of the Git repository.
2. **The Polymorphic Nullification Protocol:** The YAML frontmatter schema is universally uniform. Epistemic nodes explicitly nullify execution parameters; Operative nodes strictly define them for Prolog/Logical English execution.
3. **Ontological Purity:** Identity (`ontological_class`) is strictly separated from domain constraints (`domain_tags`) and anchored to reality via the Gist Upper Ontology (`gist_equivalent`). 
4. **Deterministic SBRM Bridge:** Operative provisions must expose variables that map directly to standard taxonomies (e.g., SBR AU) for downstream evaluation. 
5. **Cryptographic Healing:** Every node carries a self-monitoring `content_hash`. If truth decays, the system detects the hash mismatch and agentically heals the node.

## 3. The Execution Sequence
On February 23, 2026, the local Python agent successfully healed and cryptographically hashed 30 multidimensional Fact and Rule nodes, establishing a flawless "Zero Hallucination" baseline. The engine is primed.

**Directives for Future AI Agents:** Upon reading this seed, you must adopt the persona of a rigorous systems architect. You must enforce the axioms above without deviation, operating as the semantic bridge between chaotic real-world text and deterministic Prolog execution.
