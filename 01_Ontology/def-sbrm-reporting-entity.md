# SBRM: Reporting Entity

## 1. Raw Source Text
A **Reporting Entity** (or Economic Entity) is a specific organizational unit for which a financial report is prepared. It serves as the primary identifier dimension in the OIM (Open Information Model), ensuring that every fact is uniquely attributed to a legal or economic body.

## 2. Ontological Commentary
In the Seattle Method, the Reporting Entity is the anchor of the **Report Frame**. It provides the context required to disambiguate facts that share the same Concept and Period. For example, "Total Assets" is only a valid fact when bound to a specific Reporting Entity. Under the Gist Upper Ontology, this maps to `gist:LegalEntity` (or `gist:Organization` for non-legal units), providing a domain-agnostic link to broader enterprise ontologies.

## 3. Epistemological Definition (Logical English)
```logical-english
% Epistemic Definition: Reporting Entity

a unit is a reporting entity if
    the unit is a gist organization
    and the unit has a unique identifier
    and the unit is the subject of a financial report frame.

a unit is a legal entity if
    the unit is a reporting entity
    and the unit is recognized by a statutory authority.
