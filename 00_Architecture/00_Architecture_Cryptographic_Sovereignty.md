# LodgeiT Cryptographic Sovereignty Protocol

## 1. Overview
Cryptographic Sovereignty is the mechanism by which the LodgeiT Global Fleet ensures that the **Logical Payload** (the body of a node) remains untampered and synchronized with its **Ontological Metadata** (the YAML frontmatter). This protocol prevents "truth decay" and ensures that the Prolog/Datalog engine only processes verified ground-truth data.

## 2. The Hashing Mechanism
The system utilizes a deterministic hashing pipeline to create a unique digital fingerprint for every node.

### 2.1 Body Isolation
* **Separation**: The file is split at the YAML delimiters (`---`). Only the content following the second delimiter is considered the "Ground Truth Body".
* **Normalization**: The body is stripped of leading/trailing whitespace to ensure that trivial formatting does not break the cryptographic signature.

### 2.2 Algorithm Specification
* **Standard**: SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit).
* **Encoding**: UTF-8 byte stream.
* **Storage**: The resulting 64-character hexadecimal string is stored in the `integrity.content_hash` property of the YAML frontmatter.



## 3. The Agentic Healing Cycle
Integrity is maintained through a continuous loop of verification and repair:

1.  **Extraction (`heal_vault.py`)**: A Gemini 2.5 Flash agent standardizes the frontmatter and prepares the hash placeholder.
2.  **Sync (`sync_signatures.py`)**: A surgical Python script recalculates the real-time hash and updates the metadata to match the current body state.
3.  **Audit (`00_Architecture_Integrity_Scanner.py`)**: A non-destructive scanner compares the stored hash against the actual body hash. If a mismatch is detected, the node is quarantined from the inference engine.

## 4. Logical Enforcement
The **LodgeiT Global Fleet** enforces a "No Hash, No Logic" policy. Any node failing the integrity scan is excluded from the SBRM multidimensional hypercube, ensuring that financial proofs remain deterministic and zero-hallucination.
