# SBRM Consistency Rule: Revenue Dimensional Fan-Out

## Epistemological Definition (Logical English)
```logical-english
the fact set is valid for dimensional aggregation if
    the fact set has a TotalRevenue value
    and the fact set has a RevRed value
    and the fact set has a RevBlue value
    and the fact set has a RevGreen value
    and the fact set has a RevYellow value
    and the TotalRevenue value is exactly the RevRed value + the RevBlue value + the RevGreen value + the RevYellow value.
```
