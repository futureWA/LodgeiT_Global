# Architecture: System Manifest

## Executive Summary
This node serves as the **Genesis Node** for a polymorphic, neurosemantic architecture designed for the accounting and tax domains. It utilizes a "File over App" philosophy, leveraging Markdown and JSON-LD to ensure data sovereignty and cross-domain interoperability.

## 1. Core Principles
* **Polymorphism:** Data objects (Facts) are neutral substrates; their "truth" is determined by the Registry/Ruleset applied at the time of execution.
* **Semantic Grounding:** All nodes are URI-identified and mapped to the **Gist upper-level ontology** to allow non-accounting domains to interface with the hypercube.
* **Logic Decoupling:** Separation of concerns between **Facts** (01_Ontology), **Rules** (02_Rules), and **Governance** (03_Registry).

## 2. Epistemological Layering
This architecture supports multiple "ways of knowing" by allowing different **Registry** plugs:
* **Regulatory Domain:** SBRM-based accounting and tax compliance.
* **Economic Domain:** Valuation of energy-correlated assets and debasement analysis.
* **Logical Domain:** Ground truth verification via Prolog/Datalog predicates.

## 3. Structural Relations (Edges)
- **Governs:** `urn:uuid:registry-sbrm-master-ruleset`
- **Orchestrates:** `01_Ontology/`, `02_Rules/`
- **Validates:** `04_WorkingPapers/`

## 4. Execution Parameters
The system boot sequence initiates the **SBRM Logic Engine**, loading the master ruleset to process local Markdown nodes as active logic predicates.
